## Java

## Docker

[Distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) is the base image.

As java is object-compatible, docker image is generated by copying the packaged jar.
This is preferred over multi-stage docker, as multi-stage docker [downloads internet](http://blog.flurdy.com/2014/11/dont-download-internet-share-maven-ivy-docker.html)

To build and run the application at port 8080 use `docker run --rm -it -p8080:8080 $(docker build -q .)`
